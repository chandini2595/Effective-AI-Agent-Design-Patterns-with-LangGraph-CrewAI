# Effective AI Agent Design Patterns using LangGraph & CrewAI
---

## 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates six agent design patterns based on the [LangGraph Workflows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/) tutorials and the DeepLearning.ai course on [AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/).

### Each pattern is implemented using:
- ✅ **LangGraph** (all-in-one notebook)
- ✅ **CrewAI** (equivalent logic in a second notebook)

Agent traces are visualized using **LangSmith Studio**, and a single video walkthrough covers both implementations.
